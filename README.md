## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael, I am a Frontend React developer with over 2 years of experience in writing code. 

- ðŸ”­ I currently build custom websites for businesses and individuals 
- ðŸŒ± I recently built a webapp that detects the mood of the user using a zero-shot classification model and returns a list of playlists that match the user's mood. Check it out [here](https://github.com/MichaelDunsin/Music-Vibe-Matcher)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on amazing projects
